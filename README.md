# daphTrack

A simple thresholding and contour finding program I used for identifying and tracking daphnia and copepods in videos. The videos in the img directory were ones I took myself, and the additional markings added by the code are shown in the output directory.

Notably, the videos in the output directory are resized to meet GitHub maximum file size requirements, and so the picture quality is lower than ususal. All videos and their corresponding outputs can be found here in their original quality: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m4zcdxxtna5e8ql/AADDuuqyNqDyJvgGp4dEO86Oa?dl=0.

In terms of equipment, I used a compound light microscope with a digital imager to take video, as well as a digital camera on macro settings. The copeopods and daphnia were collected from the Dufferin Marsh in Schomberg, ON.
